# diffsync
This implements a simple collaborative editor for the web

It implements collaborative text editing via git's recursive 3-way merge algorithm.  This is how git merges big commits of source code. I bet you never thought it could be used for merging single-keystroke edits together!

It's actually remarkable fast, too, because it uses the amazing Myer's algorithm for the diffing!

See the index.html file for an example usage.
